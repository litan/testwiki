## Getting Started

To get going with Kojo, use the [Getting Started](http://wiki.kogics.net/kojo-codeactive-books#getting-started) book.
This book will help you learn:
* the basic turtle graphics commands in Kojo
* how to write programs to draw using these commands
* how to analyze patterns and recreate them via programs.

## Turtle commands reference
As you go through the Getting Started book, it's useful to have access to a [reference](command-reference/reference.md) of the basic turtle commands.

## Core concepts
It's also useful to be able to see all the core concepts in one place.

## Art Ideas
To spice things up as you go along, here are a bunch of art ideas.

## Colors
What's art without colors? Kojo has great support for colors, and it's good for you to know the details.
